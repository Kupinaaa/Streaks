### This is a WIP!
##### Edit date: the 3rd of April, 2023

The current look of things:

#### The app is being built with MongoDB (mongoose), ExpressJS, ReactJS (vite) and TypeScript; or basically the MERN stack
React Router might be a later addition, for a more tiktokie look with a comunity and friends tabs

#### What even is a streak?!
A streak is a record of how many days (in a row) you have been doing something (e.g habbits, workouts, etc)
or in other words a **streak** of days, hence the name 

#### If for some godforsaken reason you  have decided to try and run this thing here's what you sould do:
1. Install nodejs and mongodb
2. Run mongodb (for linux: ```sudo systemctl start mongodb```, for everything else read mongodb docs on how to start a server)
3. Go into both the back and front end folders and in each run ```npm install```
4. After you can start both the back and front end servers with ```npm run dev```

#### The basic functionality of the Streaks app (v0.1):
- [x] Display all streaks in a neat way
- [x] Update the streak count
- [x] Add Streaks (with no assigned user)
- [ ] Remove Streaks
- [ ] Update the streak name
- [ ] Github like log of streak

#### There is now a new idea to transform this project into something different, but for now I want to finnish this one, for personal use
