# Streaks

### This is a v0.1 WIP!
##### Date of writing: the 5th of Feb, 2023

#### The app is being built with MongoDB (mongoose), ExpressJS, ReactJS (vite) and TypeScript; or basically the MERN stack
React Router might be a later addition, for a more tiktokie look with a comunity and friends tabs

#### What even is a streak?!
A streak is a record of how many days (in a row) you have been doing something (e.g habbits, workouts, etc)
or in other words a **streak** of days, hence the name 

#### The basic functionality of the Streaks app:
- Add Streaks (with no assigned user)
- Edit Streaks, Update the streak count
- Remove Streaks
- Display all streaks in a neat way 
- **Maybe**, Implement a streak search
