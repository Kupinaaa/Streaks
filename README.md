### This is a v0.1 WIP!
##### Edit date: the 7th of March, 2023

The current look of things:

#### The app is being built with MongoDB (mongoose), ExpressJS, ReactJS (vite) and TypeScript; or basically the MERN stack
React Router might be a later addition, for a more tiktokie look with a comunity and friends tabs

#### What even is a streak?!
A streak is a record of how many days (in a row) you have been doing something (e.g habbits, workouts, etc)
or in other words a **streak** of days, hence the name 

#### The basic functionality of the Streaks app (v0.1):
- Add Streaks (with no assigned user)
- Edit Streaks, Update the streak count
- Remove Streaks
- Display all streaks in a neat way 

#### There is now a new idea to transform this project into something different, but for now I want to finnish this one, for personal use
